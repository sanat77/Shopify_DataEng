Shopify data engineering challenge

run `python server.py` to start the server and go to `http://localhost:3000/`

This performs buy operations and adjusts the inventory accordingly or gives an error message for insufficient stock

The database I used is a MongoDB Database. SQL can also be alternatively used for this purpose

More features can be added to this like sell or even a search option

All the features given on google docs can be added to this but I decided to go ahead with buy operation for this challenge
